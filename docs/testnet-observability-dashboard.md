# Testnet Observability Dashboard

Use the backend `/metrics`, `/health`, `/api/v1/health`, and `/jobs/health` endpoints together when Testnet behavior is unclear. Start with the request correlation ID, then check contract latency, transaction submission failures, callback failures, queue depth, and RPC health.

## Request Correlation

- Every HTTP request receives `x-correlation-id` and `x-request-id` response headers.
- Pass `x-correlation-id` on operator requests when investigating an incident.
- Onchain BullMQ jobs copy the active request correlation ID into `job.data.correlationId`, so job logs can be matched back to the API request that queued the contract action.
- Notification jobs already accept correlation IDs; use the same header value when enqueueing callbacks from request handlers.

## Metrics To Watch

| Signal | Metric | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contract latency | `contract_call_latency_seconds{operation,status}` | Slow or failed Soroban contract operations by queue operation. Watch p95/p99 by `operation`. |
| Transaction submission failures | `tx_submission_failures_total{operation,reason}` | Transaction submission or `tx_*` failures from onchain jobs. Spikes usually mean RPC congestion, expired transactions, bad sequence state, or network mismatch. |
| Callback failures | `callback_failures_total{callback_type,reason}` | Failed AI webhooks, notification delivery jobs, and onchain job failure callbacks. |
| Onchain throughput | `onchain_operations_total{operation,adapter,status}` | Existing onchain success/failure counter by adapter. |
| Job failures | `jobs_failed_total{job_type}` | Background job failures across queues. Pair with `/jobs/health`. |
| Webhook retries | `webhook_retries_total{webhook_type,reason}` | Retry pressure for webhook delivery paths. |
| Claims created | `claims_created_total{campaign_id}` | Cumulative count of claims created, broken down by campaign. |
| Claims verified | `claims_verified_total{campaign_id}` | Cumulative count of claims that passed verification. |
| Claims approved | `claims_approved_total{campaign_id}` | Cumulative count of claims approved for disbursement. |
| Claims disbursed | `claims_disbursed_total{campaign_id,onchain_enabled}` | Cumulative count of claims disbursed, labelled by whether on-chain execution was enabled. |
| Claims cancelled | `claims_cancelled_total{campaign_id,from_status}` | Cumulative count of claims cancelled, labelled by the status they were in when cancelled. |
| Claims in funnel | `claims_in_funnel{status}` | Current gauge of claims at each funnel stage (requested, verified, approved, disbursed, archived, cancelled). |
| Claim stage duration | `claim_funnel_duration_seconds{from_status,to_status}` | Time (seconds) spent in a given funnel stage before transitioning to the next. Useful for identifying bottlenecks. |
| Evidence queue depth | `evidence_queue_depth{status}` | Current number of evidence queue items per `EvidenceStatus` (`pending`, `uploading`, `completed`, `failed`). Rising `pending`/`uploading` means review/upload is falling behind intake. Refreshed once per minute. |
| Oldest pending evidence | `evidence_queue_oldest_pending_age_seconds` | Age (seconds) of the oldest evidence item still `pending`. A steadily climbing value is the clearest SLA-breach signal for the evidence backlog. `0` when nothing is pending. |
| Evidence intake→decision | `evidence_intake_to_decision_duration_seconds{status}` | Histogram of time from evidence intake to a terminal decision (`completed` or `failed`). Watch p95/p99 to see how long items take to clear the pipeline. |

## Incident Checklist

1. Find the `x-correlation-id` from the failed API response or client logs.
2. Search backend logs for that correlation ID. Follow it from the request log to any queued onchain or notification job.
3. Check `contract_call_latency_seconds` for slow `create-claim`, `disburse`, or `init-escrow` jobs.
4. Check `tx_submission_failures_total` for transaction failures. If it is increasing, compare the reason label with Stellar RPC status and the configured Testnet RPC URL.
5. Check `callback_failures_total` for failed AI task webhooks, notification delivery, or onchain job callbacks.
6. Check `/jobs/health` for waiting, active, delayed, and failed queue counts. A healthy RPC with growing queue depth points to worker capacity or Redis issues.
7. Check `/health` and `/api/v1/health` for backend, database, Redis, and Testnet RPC reachability.

## Dashboard Panels

- Contract call latency: p50, p95, p99 from `contract_call_latency_seconds` by operation and status.
- Transaction submission failures: rate of `tx_submission_failures_total` by operation and reason.
- Callback failures: rate of `callback_failures_total` by callback type and reason.
- Queue pressure: waiting, active, delayed, and failed jobs from `/jobs/status`.
- RPC health: Testnet RPC probe status from the health endpoint.
- Correlated request errors: HTTP 4xx/5xx rate grouped by route, then inspect logs by `correlationId`.
- Claim funnel: bar chart or stacked area of `claims_in_funnel` by `status` to visualise pipeline flow.
- Claim stage durations: p50/p95/p99 from `claim_funnel_duration_seconds` by `from_status`->`to_status` transition.
- Funnel conversion rates: rate of `claims_disbursed_total` / rate of `claims_created_total` to measure end-to-end throughput.
