//! # Token Amount Normalization & Validation Policy
//!
//! ## Normalization Policy
//! All token amounts passed to this contract **must be normalized to the token's smallest unit** (e.g., stroops for Stellar, wei for Ethereum, or the lowest decimal unit for the token).
//! The contract does **not** perform automatic normalization or conversion based on token decimals. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure amounts are properly scaled.
//!
//! ## Validation Rules
//! - Amounts must be strictly positive integers (`amount > 0`).
//! - Amounts must be multiples of the token's smallest unit (i.e., no precision-breaking values).
//! - Zero, negative, or non-integer values (relative to the token's decimals) are rejected.
//! - The contract assumes all amounts are already validated and normalized before being passed in.
//!
//! ## Recommendations
//! - Integrators should fetch the token's decimals and normalize user input accordingly.
//! - When adding support for new tokens, ensure all amounts are compatible with the token's decimal convention.
//!
//! ## See Also
//! - Validation is enforced in `fund`, `create_package`, and related entrypoints.
//! - Tests for invalid/edge cases are in `tests/aid_escrow_tests.rs`.
