#![cfg(test)]

//! Guards the stable numeric discriminants of the contract `Error` enum.
//!
//! The backend adapter (`app/backend/src/onchain/utils/soroban-error.mapper.ts`)
//! maps contract failures to user-facing messages by these numeric codes.
//! Reordering or removing a variant would silently break that mapping, so this
//! test pins every variant to its canonical code. New variants MUST be appended
//! with the next unused code (see the compatibility policy in README.md).
