Prometheus metrics for the AI service (issue #988: bounded label cardinality).

## Cardinality guidance for adding new metrics

Every label attached to a metric multiplies the number of time series
Prometheus stores for it. A label whose value space is not fixed at
deploy time (an id, a raw request path, a free-text error message, a
client-supplied string, a timestamp, a hash) is an *unbounded* label:
each new distinct value permanently adds a new time series that never
expires, and enough of them turns `/metrics` into an availability
problem (slow scrapes, memory growth, dropped scrapes).

Before adding a `.labels(...)` call, ask: **could this label take more
than a few dozen distinct values over the service's lifetime?** If yes,
it must be bounded before it reaches `.labels()`:

- **Request paths** (`endpoint`/`path` labels): never pass
  `request.url.path` or an ASGI `scope["path"]` directly — path
  parameters (task ids, artifact ids, session ids, ...) make it
  unbounded. Use `bounded_endpoint_label(raw_path)`, which maps the raw
  path to its registered FastAPI route *template* (e.g.
  `/v1/ai/status/{task_id}`, not `/v1/ai/status/<uuid>`), so cardinality
  is capped at the fixed number of routes the app registers at startup.
- **Task/job/model type strings sourced from a request payload**: never
  pass a client-supplied string straight through. Route it through a
  bounding helper (see `bounded_task_type`) that maps known values
  through unchanged and collapses everything else into a fixed
  `"other"` bucket.
- **Error messages / exception text**: never use `str(exc)` as a label
  value. Classify the exception into a small, fixed category first (see
  the `app/backend` precedent in
  `src/notifications/notification-failure-classifier.ts` for the same
  pattern applied to Node) — or omit the label and log the raw message
  instead, since logs (unlike metric label sets) are not indexed by
  cardinality.
- **Already-bounded values are fine as labels directly**: HTTP methods,
  status codes, a handful of hardcoded reason/outcome/kind literals, a
  small fixed provider/model registry defined in code (not user input).
  These are safe because the *set of possible values* is fixed by the
  code, not by runtime input.
- **`model` (e.g. on the `llm_*` metrics)** is a deliberate, narrower
  exception: it comes from `OPENAI_MODEL`/`GROQ_MODEL` operator config,
  never from a request, so it takes one fixed value per deploy — bounded
  in practice even though it isn't an enum in code. Never let a `model`
  value reach a label from anywhere other than that config (in
  particular, never from a client-supplied override).
- **Never label by campaign/claim/user id**, even though "attribute
  spend to a campaign" is a real need — that identifier space is
  unbounded. Do that attribution via logs or an audit record correlated
  on provider+model+timestamp, not a metric label.

`tests/test_metrics_cardinality.py` enforces this: it asserts that
`REQUEST_COUNT`/`REQUEST_LATENCY`/`REQUESTS_SHED_TOTAL`/
`REQUEST_REJECTIONS_TOTAL`/`RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED_TOTAL`'s `endpoint` label
and `INFERENCE_LATENCY`'s `task_type` label only ever take values from a
bounded set, and that a burst of requests against id-bearing routes does
not blow up `/ai/metrics`'s response size. See `METRICS_CARDINALITY.md`
for the full per-metric audit.
